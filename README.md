# Model Analysis 2
Code and reports for the projects done during the Model Analysis 2 course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana.
Most of the code is written for specific problems and needs to be modified for general usage.

### List of Projects
1. Symplectic Integration
2. Boundary Value Problem
3. Schr√∂dinger Equation
4. Hartree Fock
5. PDE - Successive over-relaxation
6. PDE - Eigenvalue Problem
7. PDE - Finite Element Method
8. PDE - Eigenvalue Problem with FEM
9. PDE - Boundary Element Method
10. PDE - FFT
11. Boundary Value Problem 2
12. Navier-Stokes system
